Using your calculator you should work out the first 10 entries of the series, where starting with 0 and 1 (the first and second entries) each new number in the series is simply the sum of the two before it. Hence perform the following;

Entry 0 = 0
Entry 1 = 1
Entry 2 = (0+1) = 1
Entry 3 = (1+1) = 2
Entry 4 = (1+2) = 3

and continue until you determine the tenth entry. Confirm that the tenth entry is equal to 34.
